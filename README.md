# password-generator

## Description
This web app randomly generates a password based on provided user criteria. The user is prompted to provide a password length, and the character types they would like to see in their password. Click the button to try it out! Souce code for HTML, CSS, and a JS function call on button press was provided by my bootcamp. I created JS functionality for alert box styles. My function collects the data from user inputs and stores them for use in password generation. Checkout out the JS for my work!
